## It is fork of likeastore notifier module which looked to be abondoned, I am trying to relive the module as it suits my needs for one of my project.

I have updated all the dependencies to latest versions as of 20-Aug-2016.

# Notifier

HTTP API that receives the event and turning that event into corresponding notification.

## API

The entry point of application responsible for initializing the `notifier`.

```js
var notifier = require('./source/notifier');

notifier.start(5050);
```

To initialize the `notifier` you should create 3 entities - `actions`, `resolvers` and `executors`.

### Receiving event

`notifier` exposes `.receive()` call to initialize particular action. The action `callback` is called then `server` receives event with defined type.

```js
notifier.receive('user-registered', function (event, actions, callback) {
	actions.create('send-welcome-email', {user: event.user}, callback);
});
```

You can define as many actions as you need for same event.

```js
notifier.receive('user-payment-recieved', function (event, actions, callback) {
	actions.create('send-invoice-email', {user: event.user, payment: event.amount}, callback);
});

notifier.receive('user-payment-recieved', function (event, actions, callback) {
	actions.create('notify-developers-sms', {user: event.user}, callback);
});
```

### Resolving action

To resolve an action, `notifier` should define resolved. Usually resolve calls database or other service for additional data.

```js
notifier.resolve('user-registered', function (action, actions, callback) {
	db.user.findOne({email: action.email}, function (err, user) {
		if (err) {
			return callback(err);
		}

		var data = {
			email: user.email,
			firstName: user.firstName,
			secondName: user.secondName,
			registered: user.registered
		};

		actions.resolved(action, data, callback);
	});
});
```

Note, there should be only one resolve function for action, otherwise the exception is thrown.

### Skipping action

For any reason, action could be skipped, means that it could be resolved but will not be executed.

```js
notifier.resolve('user-registered', function (action, actions, callback) {
	db.user.findOne({email: action.email}, function (err, user) {
		if (err) {
			return callback(err);
		}

		if (user.email === 'test@example.com') {
			return actions.skipped(action, callback);
		}

		actions.resolved(action, {data: 123}, callback);
	});
});
```


### Executing action

Once action got resolve, it's ready to be executed.

```js
notifier.execute('user-registered', function (action, transport, callback) {
		var vars = [
			{name: 'FIRST_NAME', content: action.data.firstName}
			{name: 'SECOND_NAME', content: action.data.secondName}
			{name: 'REGISTERED_DATE', content: action.data.registered}
		];

		transport.mandrill('/messages/send-template', {
			template_name: 'welcome-email',
			template_content: [],

			message: {
				to: [{email: user.email}],
				global_merge_vars: vars
			}
		}, callback);
});
```

### Events aggregation

TDB.

## Transports

Each `.execute()` function callback receives `transport` object, which exposes intialized transports clients libraries.

Supported now:
* [Mandrill](https://github.com/jimrubenstein/node-mandrill)
* [Twilio](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-node)
* [Android push notification](https://github.com/ToothlessGear/node-gcm)
* [iOS push notification](https://github.com/argon/node-apn)

Will be added soon:
* [Mailgun](https://github.com/jimrubenstein/node-mandrill)

If you want to extend transport support:

1. Fork this repo
2. Update [transport.js](/source/transport.js)
3. Update [config/*.js](/config/development.js) files with new transport section.
4. Send PR.


## REST Hooks

When `notifier` completed `execution` and you want to notify external service about it, use [REST hooks](http://resthooks.org/).
Let's say we want to notify external service that push notification failed for some reason, for that purpose we use
`notifier.sendHook(event,data)`

```js
 transport.android.push({ message: message, regIds: regIds, retries: 1}, function (err, result) {
	if (err || result.failure === 1) {
		var data = {
			clientId: a.data.clientId,
			message: message,
			status: result.success
		};

		notifier.sendHook('notify.sms', data);
	}

	return callback(err, result);
});
```
Note, that you have to setup config with hook configuration, namely:

```js
hook: {
	url: 'http://localhost:5000/api/notify/',
	token: 'fake-hook-token'
},
```
where `url` is url of your external system that you'd like to notify and `token` is simply authentication mechanism to be able to talk to our external system.


## How to use?

Clone repo,

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:likeastore/notifier.git
```

Create `app.js` file,

```js
var notifier = require('./source/notifier');

// initialize actions, resolvers and executors
notifier
	.receive('incoming-event', function () { /* ... */ })
	.resolve('created-action', function () { /* ... */ })
	.execute('created-action', function () { /* ... */ });

// start the server
notifier.start(process.env.PORT);
```

Update `development.config.js` and `production.config.js` configuration. For now, configuration requires connection string to MongoDB, accessToken (shared secret) to access service, mandrill and logentries tokens.

Commit the changes and deploy (heroku, dokku, aws).

```bash
$ git push master heroku
```

Check the server deployed fine,

```bash
$ curl http://notifier.likeastore.com/
{"app":"notifier","env":"production","version":"0.0.5","apiUrl":"/api"}%
```

Send first notification,

```bash
$ echo '{"event": "incoming-event"}' | curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d @- http://notifier.likeastore.com/api/events?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## Getting started

Check the following code for guidance.

* [example/server.js](example/server.js) with ready to use `notifier` server.
* [production](https://github.com/likeastore/notifier/tree/production) version of notifier used by Likeastore
